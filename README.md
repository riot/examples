# Riot Examples

Demos and examples for [Riot](http://riotjs.com/) and submodules.
This repository is maintained by Riot community.

*Note: we're preparing this repo for next Riot v2.3 release.*

## Playground

This is the simplest example, and also an easy tutorial. Let's start this from [here](#under-construction). Read the comment inside the code, write a few line, then you'll be an expert of Riot.js!
